This article provides information on the visa options available, day-to-day life in Singapore, the web3/crypto community, travel insurance, living costs, as well as my personal experience living here. If you&apos;re considering living in Singapore as a web3/crypto person, this document is a must-read.</em></p><h2 id="visa">Visa</h2><p>Singapore is a great place to live as a web3/crypto person. One of the first things you&apos;ll need to consider is your visa status. Fortunately, Singapore offers a variety of visa options for those who want to live and work in the country.</p><p>The most common visa is the Employment Pass (EP), which is designed for skilled professionals and entrepreneurs. To be eligible for an EP, you&apos;ll need to have a job offer from a Singaporean company or be a founder of a startup in the country. Other visa options include the Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) and the EntrePass, which are designed for highly skilled individuals and entrepreneurs respectively.</p><p>If you are from Europe they offer 3 month tourist visa. I have been using that since i arrived in September 2022. You just have to make sure to go on a holiday more than one time per 3 months. &#x1F609;</p><h2 id="day-to-day-life">Day-to-day life</h2><p>Living in Singapore as a web3/crypto person is easy and convenient. The city-state is known for its high standard of living, excellent public transportation, and safe streets.</p><p>When it comes to day-to-day life, you&apos;ll find that Singapore has everything you need. From world-class restaurants and shopping malls to beautiful parks and hanging out with amazing people.</p><p>For me, Singapore is like a calm bubble where everyone is friendly and relaxed in a way I find really rare these days.</p><h2 id="web3-community">WEB3 community</h2><p>Singapore has a thriving web3/crypto community, with a number of meetups and conferences taking place throughout the year. Attending these events is a great way to network with other web3/crypto professionals and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.</p><p>Some of the most popular web3/crypto events in Singapore include SGInnovate, the Singapore Fintech Festival, and the BlockShow Asia conference. Not to forget <a href="https://www.asia.token2049.com/?ref=wagmit-se-web3-remote-lifestyle-and-ai-future">token2049</a> that in my opinion was the best last year.</p><h2 id="travel-insurance">Travel Insurance</h2><p>As a web3/crypto person living in Singapore, it&apos;s important to have <a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=24784443&amp;3Butm_source=24784443&amp;3Butm_medium=Ambassador&amp;ref=wagmit-se-web3-remote-lifestyle-and-ai-future">travel insurance</a>. This is especially true if you plan to travel frequently for work or leisure. Travel insurance will provide you with protection against unexpected events such as flight cancellations, lost luggage, and medical emergencies.</p><p>When choosing a travel insurance policy, make sure to read the fine print carefully. Look for policies that cover adventure activities like surfing. If you are like me and are into that. &#x1F3C4;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;</p><p>For me, SafetyWing was the best option. Their policies are affordable and flexible, allowing you to choose the coverage that best fits your needs. They offer coverage for unexpected events such as flight cancellations, lost luggage and medical emergencies. SafetyWing also offers a unique feature called &quot;<a href="https://safetywing.com/?referenceID=24784443&amp;3Butm_source=24784443&amp;3Butm_medium=Ambassador&amp;ref=wagmit-se-web3-remote-lifestyle-and-ai-future">remote health</a>,&quot; which provides coverage for telemedicine and other virtual healthcare services. Overall, SafetyWing is a great choice for anyone who values flexibility, affordability, and comprehensive coverage. Note that you can start the insurance even if you already started your traveling, which is unusual for other travel insurance.</p><p>As a Swede, we usually have 45 days of insurance included in the home insurance. This might be true for other countries as well. I recommend you check out.</p><h2 id="living-costs">Living costs</h2><p>Singapore is known for being an expensive place to live, but as a web3/crypto person, you&apos;ll likely have a higher-than-average salary. And believe me, you get what you pay for. The cost of living in Singapore can vary greatly depending on your lifestyle and the neighborhood you choose to live in.</p><p>For example, if you choose to live in a luxury condominium in the heart of the city, you can expect to pay upwards of $5,000 SGD per month in rent. However, if you&apos;re willing to live a bit further out from the city center, you can find more affordable housing options. Or you can do like me and choose a coliving. We got our own room and bath, and share the kitchen. Which is ideal since we have not cooked a single dish since we arrived. &#x1F602; In this way we can live in the city center for under $3,000 SGD per month. Since food is crazy cheap and spend 70-90% on rent.</p><p>Overall, Singapore is a great place to live as a web3/crypto person. With its thriving web3/crypto community, high standard of living, and excellent infrastructure, it&apos;s no wonder why so many people are choosing to call this city-state home.</p><p>Please let me know if you go here and I&apos;m happy to meet up! &#x1F44B;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[wagmit.eth | Y00ts]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is wagmit.se | WEB3 remote lifestyle and AI future, a brand new site by wagmit.eth that&apos;s just getting started.
